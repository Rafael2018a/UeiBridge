Hi Rafi,


Thatâ€™s strange.  It could be that you is disposing of the session while an asynchronous call is being executed.

In the callback, you should verify that the session is still valid and running


            if (SrlSession!=null && SrlSession.IsRunning())

            {
               readerIAsyncResult = SrlReader.BeginRead(200, readerAsyncCallback, null);
            }

And when stopping, you should wait for the last callback to complete before disposing

               SrlSession.Stop();

               // wait for current async call to complete

               // before destroying the session

               readerIAsyncResult.AsyncWaitHandle.WaitOne();

               SrlSession.Displose();


Please give this a try and let me know.

 

Thanks
